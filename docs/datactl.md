## datactl

datactl provides tooling to export data from operators

### Synopsis

The datactl provides tooling for exporting data from disconnected cluster operators. To use this tool, there must be a Dataservice installed on the cluster and you must have access to it via the local network. The most optimal place is a jump host in a disconnected network.

```
datactl [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Configure your system.
  datactl config init
  
  # Pull files from dataservice.
  datactl export pull
  
  # Commit files from dataservice; tells dataservice you
  # acknowledge their delivery.
  datactl export commit
  
  # Push to the configured upload API.
  datactl export push
```
